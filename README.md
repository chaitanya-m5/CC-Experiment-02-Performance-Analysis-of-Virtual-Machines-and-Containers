# Performance Analysis of Virtual Machines and Containers

## Overview

This experiment evaluates the performance of workloads running in a Virtual Machine (VM) and Docker Container environment.
The analysis covers CPU, memory, disk I/O, network throughput, application response time, container startup time, and application scalability.
The experiment was conducted using Ubuntu 24.04 running inside VMware Workstation with Docker installed for container-based benchmarking.

## Objectives

* Measure CPU performance
* Measure memory performance
* Measure disk I/O performance
* Measure network throughput
* Compare FastAPI application performance
* Measure container startup time
* Evaluate application scalability
* Automate benchmark execution
* Analyze and visualize the collected results

## Benchmark Methodology

The experiment was divided into system-level and application-level performance testing.

### System-Level Performance
* CPU
* Memory
* Disk I/O
* Network throughput

### Application-Level Performance
* FastAPI response time
* Container startup time
* Application scalability

All benchmark measurements were stored as raw results and analyzed using Python.

### CPU Performance
CPU performance was measured using Sysbench with four threads for ten seconds. The benchmark records events per second, execution time, total events, and latency.

### Memory Performance
Memory throughput was measured using Sysbench with four threads for ten seconds. The benchmark records memory transferred, throughput, and total operations.

### Disk I/O Performance
Disk performance was measured using fio with a 1 GB test file, 1 MB block size, direct I/O, and a 10-second read/write workload. The benchmark records read bandwidth, write bandwidth, IOPS, and latency.

### Network Performance
Network throughput was measured using iperf3. The measured throughput for the tested local container networking path was approximately **53.1 Gbits/sec**. This represents the tested local host/container networking path and not external Internet bandwidth.

## FastAPI Application Benchmark

A FastAPI application was developed for application-level performance testing containing two endpoints:
* `/`: Returns a simple JSON response.
* `/compute`: Performs a CPU-intensive calculation by computing the sum of squares for one million integers.

The `/compute` endpoint was tested in both the VM and Docker container environments.

## Performance Analysis

### FastAPI Response Time

| Environment | Real Time |
| --- | --- |
| VM | 0.095 s |
| Container | 0.091 s |

The measured difference for this test was **-4.21%**.

### Container Startup Time

| Run | Real Time |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | 0.699 s |
| 2 | 0.622 s |
| 3 | 0.621 s |

#### Startup Statistics

| Metric | Time |
| --- | --- |
| Average | 0.647 s |
| Minimum | 0.621 s |
| Maximum | 0.699 s |

### Scalability Analysis

The FastAPI application was tested with increasing numbers of concurrent requests.

| Concurrent Requests | Real Time |
| --- | --- |
| 10 | 0.787 s |
| 20 | 1.513 s |
| 50 | 3.867 s |

The results show how execution time changes as the number of concurrent requests increases.

## Results Summary

| Metric | Result |
| --- | --- |
| VM API response time | 0.095 s |
| Container API response time | 0.091 s |
| API measured difference | -4.21% |
| Average startup time | 0.647 s |
| Minimum startup time | 0.621 s |
| Maximum startup time | 0.699 s |
| 10 concurrent requests | 0.787 s |
| 20 concurrent requests | 1.513 s |
| 50 concurrent requests | 3.867 s |
| Network throughput | 53.1 Gbits/sec |

## Automation

Benchmark execution was partially automated using `scripts/run_benchmarks.sh`. The script runs CPU and memory benchmarks and stores the extracted results.

The analysis was performed using `scripts/analyze_results.py`. The analysis generates summary statistics and performance graphs.

## Key Observations

* CPU, memory, disk, and network workloads were benchmarked.
* A FastAPI workload was used for application-level testing.
* VM and container API response times were measured using the same workload.
* Container startup time was measured over multiple runs.
* Application scalability was evaluated with increasing concurrent requests.
* Raw benchmark data was preserved for reproducibility.
* Performance graphs were generated from the collected measurements.

## Conclusion

This experiment provides a practical performance analysis of virtual machines and containers using both system-level and application-level workloads. The study combines benchmark measurements with a FastAPI application to evaluate response time, startup behavior, and scalability. The raw results, processed analysis, benchmark scripts, and performance visualizations provide a reproducible record of the experiment.
